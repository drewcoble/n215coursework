          <b>Peak Design</b> launched on Kickstarter in 2010, just one year
          after the crowdfunding platform was founded. At the time, the brand
          raised nearly $360K in funding — not a huge amount by modern
          standards, but in 2010 it tallied as the second most funded campaign
          to-date. Since then, Peak Design has come back to the platform once a
          year, for 6 years straight, each time bringing real innovation and
          fueling the company’s fan-base. <br /><br />Today, Peak Design has
          transformed itself from a one-trick pony to one of the most envied
          brands in all of
        </div>
        <div>
          crowdfunding. Peak Design finished their 2016 campaign with over $7.2M
          in crowdfunding and more than 29,000 customers capitalizing on the
          pre-sales. Total all Peak Design’s campaigns, and you’ll find they are
          they most crowdfunded brand in business.<br /><br />
          Purple Orange has been the AOR for Peak Design on 4 out of 6 campaigns
          over the last 6 years. With limited product samples and racing against
          the clock, each year Purple Orange has delivered the kind of national
          media attention that drives revenue into the eight figures.
